        <h3>Advanced Data Associates</h3>
        <p>
          I worked full-time at Advanced Data Associates as a salesmen during the summer of 2021. I was tasked with handling calls on a daily basis and directing our customers to products made by our buisness partners. During this time I was regarded as a top salesmen and respected by my co-workers.
